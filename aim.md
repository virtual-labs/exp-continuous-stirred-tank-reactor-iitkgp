## Aim of experiment

- A continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) is a type of chemical reactor that is widely used in industrial processes to produce chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and other products. In a CSTR, reactants are continuously fed into the reactor vessel shown in this experiment, where they are mixed and allowed to react, producing the desired products.
